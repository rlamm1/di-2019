# Suspended in Time
For my final clock representation I utilized the #shape and #value
retinal variable to map onto the 3 traditional clock variables. 
- The seconds = circle
- The minutes = triangle
- The hours = square
- As the clock variable increases in length, the alpha value also increases 
- (resulting in the square being almost fully filled)
` 
  For the additional date variables, I choose to use the progress of
 A #day, #mooncycle, and #week
    
-The retinal variable of #color and #orientation is mapped onto the day
-The retinal variable of #value, #scale, #shape, #orientation is mapped onto the moon
-The retinal variable of #value, #scale, #shape, #color, #orientation is mapped onto the week

## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.


1. Atmosphere in Years 
Confined data set focusing on the years of atmospheric testing in five countries and the counts of tests in each location

2. USSR Altitudes
Stricly honing in on the height dataset from all the USSR nuclear tests between 1949-1990
#2versionsincluded

3. Gerboise Series
Focuses on a very small data set, the Gerboise Series, in France between 1960-1966

addition data set: ???

-shot names color code RAINBOW CODE ??

-societal anxiety, nationalism
-technology behind these things example: moon mission, overlap
-data doesn't have to be something you can numerically combine 
-some will be bars on timeline 
-info what is telling??
